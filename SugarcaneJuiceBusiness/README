Sugarcane Juice Business
While Alice was drinking sugarcane juice, she started wondering about the following facts:
The juicer sells each glass of sugarcane juice for 50 coins.
He spends 20% of his total income on buying sugarcane.
He spends 20% of his total income on buying salt and mint leaves.
He spends 30% of his total income on shop rent.
Alice wonders, what is the juicer's profit (in coins) when he sells N glasses of sugarcane juice?

Input Format
The first line of input will contain an integer T — the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains an integer N, as described in the problem statement.

Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the juicer's profit when he sells N glasses of juice.

Formulas:
totalexpenses=0.2×totalincome+0.2×totalincome+0.3×totalincome
totalexpenses=0.7×totalincome
Profit is defined as:
profit=totalincome−totalexpenses
profit=totalincome−0.7×totalincome
profit=0.3×totalincome          // Since 70% of the income is spent, the remaining 30% is profit,So there is 0.3
profitperglass=0.3×50=15coins
